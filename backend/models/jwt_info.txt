JWT = JSON Web Token

JWT's are used for securing API's.

It is an open standard used to share security information between 
two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON 
objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a 
cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered 
after the token is issued.

What are tokens? To put it simply, a token is a string of data that 
represents something else, such as an identity. In the case of 
authentication, a non-JWT based token is a string of characters 
that allow the receiver to validate the sender’s identity. 
The important distinction here is lack of meaning within the 
characters themselves.
